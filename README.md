# Frontend-Yoga-Clone
Cloning a Yoga Landing Page

This is a basic front-end clone of a basic yoga business/landing page. HTML markup was intended to be accessible through the use of semantic markup and alt text on images. Styling was done through the use of Sass to compile my CSS. I used icons from http://Feathericons.com to style the arrow "buttons" and the menu icon in the top left. My goal for this project was to become more familiar with CSS Grid, Flexbox, transitions, semantic HTML, and color.
